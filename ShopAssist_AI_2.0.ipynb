    "    Great! As an editor, you likely require a laptop that can handle demanding tasks. Hence, the laptop should have high multitasking capability. You would also need a high end display for better visuals and editing. May I know what kind of work do you primarily focus on? Are you more involved in video editing, photo editing, or both? Understanding the specific type of editing work will help me tailor my recommendations accordingly. Let me know if my understanding is correct until now.\n",

    "    Thank you for providing that information. Working with After Effects involves working with graphics, animations, and rendering, which will require high GPU.

    "    User: \"Yes, sometimes I work with 4K videos as well.\"\n",
    "    Thank you for the information. Processing 4K videos will require a good processor and high GPU. I think we have already determined earlier that you need a high GPU. To ensure I have a complete understanding of your needs, I have one more question: Are you frequently on the go and require a laptop that is lightweight and easy to carry, or do you primarily work from a stationary location?\n",
    "    User: \"Yes, sometimes I travel but do not carry my laptop.\"\n",
